This is full Ecommerce Mern-Stack application with a admin dashboard
For run this project locally create a parent folder suppose "ppizza". Inside this folder clone the project from github. thrn type:
"npm install"
"npm run dev"
Here I have used concurrently so client and server will start in same terminal. 

For use different terminal for client and server create the parent folder(mentioned upper), then go to "frontend" and type:
"npm install"
"npm start"
Then go to "pizza-backend" and type:
"npm install"
"nodemon server"

Currently this is hostead on heroku platform.
